## Getting started

**Creating your own repo based on this one**  
- Create a new *empty* git repo (using github or git init)
- After you cloned the repo, go to the repo folder and type:  
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/smore-inc/react-native-hackathon-bootstrap.git
git pull upstream master
git push origin master
```
- You're all set! now go and run the setup script!

**Running setup script**  
*The setup script only works for mac, sorry*
First, you need to download and install [XCode 6.4](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
Then, go to the project folder and run:
```sh
./hack init
```
Follow the setup script, you may be asked for your password (this is required for installing cocoapods)

**Editor Setup**  
For editing the React native app code, we suggest you use [Atom](http://www.atom.io) / [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

If you choose to use Atom, you can run the `./hack init-atom` to automatically install a few packages that
will help you with the development process.
The packages:
- [react](https://atom.io/packages/react)
- [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)
- [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint)
- [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)
- [tree-view-git-status](https://atom.io/packages/tree-view-git-status)
